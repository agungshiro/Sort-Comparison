# Sort-Comparison

Sorting Algorithm performance comparison. 
Theoritically the best performance would be Quick sort, followed by Merge sort and than Insertion sort. But I still don't understand, because in my program which is written on java I got Insertion sort as the best performance. Maybe anyone can help me, what's wrong with my code..
